This directory will contain the Java implementation of the Poker at Berkeley bot framework.

## Future Implementation

The Java implementation will include:

- A Java bot class that students can extend

- Engine communication code

## Getting Started (Coming Soon)

Instructions for setting up and running a Java bot will be provided here.

## Structure (Planned)

- `Player.java`: Main bot implementation that players will modify
- `skeleton/`: Core framework components
  - `Action.java`: Defines poker actions
  - `Bot.java`: Base bot interface
  - `GameState.java`: Game state representation
  - `Runner.java`: Communication with the poker engine
