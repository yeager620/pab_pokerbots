# LEGACY FILE - TO BE UPDATED
# This test file references the old complex structure (tournament/ directory)
# which was consolidated into tournaments.py during infrastructure simplification.
# Needs to be rewritten to test TournamentManager from tournaments.py

# TODO: Rewrite to test tournaments.TournamentManager
# from models.core import Tournament, TournamentStatus, BotStatus  
# from tournaments import TournamentManager
