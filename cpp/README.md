# C++ Implementation for Poker at Berkeley PokerBots

This directory will contain the C++ implementation of the Poker at Berkeley bot framework.

## Future Implementation

The C++ implementation will include:

- A C++ bot class that students can extend
- Game state and action classes
- Engine communication code
- Build system (CMake)

## Getting Started (Coming Soon)

Instructions for setting up, building, and running a C++ bot will be provided here.

## Structure (Planned)

- `src/main.cpp`: Entry point for the bot
- `libs/skeleton/`: Core framework components
  - `include/skeleton/actions.h`: Defines poker actions
  - `include/skeleton/bot.h`: Base bot interface
  - `include/skeleton/states.h`: Game state representation
  - `include/skeleton/runner.h`: Communication with the poker engine
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Build configuration
- `build.sh`: Build script
- `run.sh`: Run script

## Example Strategy (Coming Soon)

A sample implementation will be provided as a starting point.
